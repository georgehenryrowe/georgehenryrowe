				<p>An updated and vastly improved version of our BBC Game Maker for their flagship brand. So many new goodies you can do with this; an object based logic system, multiple levels, scrolling levels, contextual help system, an updated publishing system, amazing new graphics, scores, timers, health, music and so much more. It's bleeding awesome.</p>

						<h3>Super cool music visuals</h3>

					</figcaption>

				</figure></a>

				<p>Around about the time we finished making Make It: Technobabble, we were thinking "What other cool things can we make with this codebase?" At a similar time, a BBC R+D team pitched an idea at Connected Studios to make a music visualiser creator which would inspire Digital Creativity in the yoot. These two things combined, along with super cool art from people like <a href="http://news.richt-what.co.uk/">RichT</a>, <a href="https://www.behance.net/adoraattack">Adora Attacks</a>, Melbs, Peskimo, Ciaran O'Connor and more, and made Vizii. We built them to be easily converted to different brands, so along with BBC Introducing one, there is also a <a href="https://www.mixital.co.uk/channel/wordcraft-vizii">Poetry version</a>, and <a href="https://www.mixital.co.uk/channel/ten-pieces-vizii">Classical version</a>.</p>

						<h3>Epic poem learning</h3>

					</figcaption>

				</figure></a>

				<p>The BBC charged us at Aardman with making a couple of prototype interactive videos to user test how people engaged with different types of e-learning content. This was mine; layers of 2D Flash animation layered up in After Effects in a 3D space, with a layer of parallaxing animation over the top (created in Flash and exported with CreateJS), and then a layer of HTML over the top for accessible learning content. Layers! Can't link here, but <a href="mailto:georgehenryrowe@gmail.com">email me</a> if you want to play with it.</p>
