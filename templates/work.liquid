				<p>An updated and vastly improved version of our BBC Game Maker for their flagship brand. So many new goodies you can do with this; an object based logic system, multiple levels, scrolling levels, contextual help system, an updated publishing system, amazing new graphics, scores, timers, health, music and so much more. It's bleeding awesome.</p>

						<h3>Super cool music visuals</h3>

					</figcaption>

				</figure></a>

				<p>Around about the time we finished making Make It: Technobabble, we were thinking "What other cool things can we make with this codebase?" At a similar time, a BBC R+D team pitched an idea at Connected Studios to make a music visualiser creator which would inspire Digital Creativity in the yoot. These two things combined, along with super cool art from people like <a href="http://news.richt-what.co.uk/">RichT</a>, <a href="https://www.behance.net/adoraattack">Adora Attacks</a>, Melbs, Peskimo, Ciaran O'Connor and more, and made Vizii. We built them to be easily converted to different brands, so along with BBC Introducing one, there is also a <a href="https://www.mixital.co.uk/channel/wordcraft-vizii">Poetry version</a>, and <a href="https://www.mixital.co.uk/channel/ten-pieces-vizii">Classical version</a>.</p>

				<p>We took our Make It core from Technobabble, and turned it into an animated comic book maker. This first version was for Eastenders, with cool characters drawn by Aardman storyboard artist Rob Richards.</p>

						<h3>Epic poem learning</h3>

					</figcaption>

				</figure></a>

				<p>The BBC charged us at Aardman with making a couple of prototype interactive videos to user test how people engaged with different types of e-learning content. This was mine; layers of 2D Flash animation layered up in After Effects in a 3D space, with a layer of parallaxing animation over the top (created in Flash and exported with CreateJS), and then a layer of HTML over the top for accessible learning content. Layers! Can't link here, but <a href="mailto:georgehenryrowe@gmail.com">email me</a> if you want to play with it.</p>

We made two things to help them (hopefully) raise even more than <a href="http://www.gromitunleashed.org.uk/">Gromit Unleashed's</a> Â£2.6 mil; a really slick fully responsive Drupal website, and an <a href="http://onelink.to/6u6psn">iOS/Android app</a> built in Unity. The app uses GPS to help you find all the sculptures, and you can collect achievements and view your and global stats using our API. Pow.</p>

				<p>The Make It kits are part of the BBC's Year of Digital Creativity for 2015, and this first version is a game maker built in HTML5/JS and built on the <a href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser</a> framework. Attempting to teach kids to be logical and creative, rather than straight coding languages, 600,000+ unique users have so far made games with the tool.</p>
