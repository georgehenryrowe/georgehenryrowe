			<p class="fadeIn2s">You walk away from the blinking of the monitor, through the devestation, towards what you presume must be the exit of the cockpit.</p>

			<p class="fadeIn4s">The metal portal at the end is the seemingly the only intact thing in the room. Your weight pressing against it yields nothing.</p>

			<p class="fadeIn6s">Disappointed, you start to turn...Is disappointment the first emotion you have felt since waking up? It seems strange that in a scene of horror and unimaginable violence, the disappointment of an steadfast door is what has first piqued inside you.</p>

			<p class="fadeIn10s">Pondering this strange malaise in your emotions, you walk toward the <span class="blink"><a href="4a">flickering monitor in the far corner</a></span>.</p>
