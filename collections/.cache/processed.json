Some people think they are ugly; <a href=\"http://gifs.com/5CW\">how little they know...</a></p>\r\n\t\t<p>This is pretty easy to achieve in CSS:</p>\r\n\t\t<p>1. First, choose your colours, however many you like. I used <a href=\"http://colours.neilorangepeel.com/\">this site</a> to pick some particularly nifty ones. We're going to be all 2013 about it and use SCSS variables.</p>\r\n\t\t<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/georgehenryrowe/d88ff8ecacb3e9294507.js\"></script>\r\n\t\t<p>2. Now that we have our colours, we need to create keyframes of each different colour to cycle through when we rollover an element. Make your increments regular, and remember to finish on the same colour that you started on so you don't get a jump.</p>\r\n\t\t<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/georgehenryrowe/9631589.js\"></script> \r\n\t\t<p>3. Once the keyframes are setup it's just a matter of adding the animation on the rollover of our links.</p>\r\n\t\t<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/georgehenryrowe/9631739.js\"></script>\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t<p>Et voila: infinitely changing colour rollovers. You can apply this method to anything really; the top bar of the site is also cycling through these colours over 90 seconds.</p>\r\n\t</section>\r\n</div>",

It was a top night, and thanks to all who came down.</p>\r\n\t\t<img src=\"../public/images/thanks_letter.jpg\">\r\n\t\t<p>We once again raised more money than we spent on the Panto (which you proabably worked out if you saw it), and have finally got our shiz together and donated it to the <a href=\"http://juliantrust.org.uk/\">Julian Trust homeless shelter</a> in Portland Square, Bristol.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>We gave them Â£335, which isn't too shabby considering this is a seperate pot to the money raised on the actual day of the panto. So, once again massive thanks to everyone who put in the long hours that and hard work that our (my) lackadaisical preparation schedule necessitates.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>Please like our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PictonStreetTheatreCo\">Facebook page</a> to hear about more exciting things like this blog post :/</p>\r\n\t\t<p><small>NB yeah okay we only raised enough money for them to run for a fifth of a week, but that is better than nothing.</small></p>\r\n\t\t<p><small>NB#2 I didn't ask them to just thank me in the letter. I honestly didn't.</small></p>\r\n\t</section>\r\n</div>",
