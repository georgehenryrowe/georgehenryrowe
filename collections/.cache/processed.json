Some people think they are ugly; <a href=\"http://gifs.com/5CW\">how little they know...</a></p>\r\n\t\t<p>This is pretty easy to achieve in CSS:</p>\r\n\t\t<p>1. First, choose your colours, however many you like. I used <a href=\"http://colours.neilorangepeel.com/\">this site</a> to pick some particularly nifty ones. We're going to be all 2013 about it and use SCSS variables.</p>\r\n\t\t<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/georgehenryrowe/d88ff8ecacb3e9294507.js\"></script>\r\n\t\t<p>2. Now that we have our colours, we need to create keyframes of each different colour to cycle through when we rollover an element. Make your increments regular, and remember to finish on the same colour that you started on so you don't get a jump.</p>\r\n\t\t<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/georgehenryrowe/9631589.js\"></script> \r\n\t\t<p>3. Once the keyframes are setup it's just a matter of adding the animation on the rollover of our links.</p>\r\n\t\t<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/georgehenryrowe/9631739.js\"></script>\r\n\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t<p>Et voila: infinitely changing colour rollovers. You can apply this method to anything really; the top bar of the site is also cycling through these colours over 90 seconds.</p>\r\n\t</section>\r\n</div>",

It was a top night, and thanks to all who came down.</p>\r\n\t\t<img src=\"../public/images/thanks_letter.jpg\">\r\n\t\t<p>We once again raised more money than we spent on the Panto (which you proabably worked out if you saw it), and have finally got our shiz together and donated it to the <a href=\"http://juliantrust.org.uk/\">Julian Trust homeless shelter</a> in Portland Square, Bristol.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>We gave them Â£335, which isn't too shabby considering this is a seperate pot to the money raised on the actual day of the panto. So, once again massive thanks to everyone who put in the long hours that and hard work that our (my) lackadaisical preparation schedule necessitates.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>Please like our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PictonStreetTheatreCo\">Facebook page</a> to hear about more exciting things like this blog post :/</p>\r\n\t\t<p><small>NB yeah okay we only raised enough money for them to run for a fifth of a week, but that is better than nothing.</small></p>\r\n\t\t<p><small>NB#2 I didn't ask them to just thank me in the letter. I honestly didn't.</small></p>\r\n\t</section>\r\n</div>",

HTML5 is the most recent HTML spec, with new features and ways of doing things. </p></li>\n\n\t\t\t<p><li>They are actually comprised of lots of browser features like WebGL, JavaScript, GLSL, Web Audio, Canvas, DOM, CSS3 etcâ¦</p></li>\n\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\n\t\t\t<p><b>When should I make an HTML5 games?</b></p>\n\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\n\t\t\t<p><li>When you want a game that can run in the browser on desktop, tablet, and mobile.</p></li>\n\n\t\t\t<p><li>You can also make an app by wrapping the code up in something like CocoonJS</p></li>\n\n\t\t\t<p><li>â¦but if an app is your <b>primary platform</b> then you should probably be thinking about Unity, with an option of the WebGL export for a browser version.</p></li>\n\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\n\t\t\t<p><b>What if I want to support IE8?</b></p>\n\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\n\t\t\t<p><li>Then you will need to do everything in the DOM (see below) and not use canvas; this means NO PHASER!</p></li>\n\n\t\t\t<p><li>But donât do thisâ¦IE8 is OLD. Some schools might be stuck on this because of archaic IT policy and machines, but it is terrible.</p></li>\n\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\n\t\t\t<h3>So what is an âhtml5â game made of?</h3>\n\n\t\t\t<p><b>Phaser</b></p>\n\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\n\t\t\t<p><li>Is a game framework developed by our ex-tech direction, Rich Davey. Itâs very good.</p></li>\n\n\t\t\t<p><li>It can deal with lots of the stuff you will need to do out of the box, and is completely free!</p></li>\n\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\n\t\t\t<p><b>HTML, CSS, JS: THE BUILD</b></p>\n\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\n\t\t\t<p><li>The live <b>build</b> of your game will be comprised to three elements:</p></li>\n\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>o <b>HTML: </b>this is the actual nodes on the page, the building blocks on any webpage. In a Phaser game this will be a &lt;canvas&gt; element with a width and a height, which is a lump of plain graphics data of that size. You might add other HTML things over the top if you like: text forms, alerts, etc. This what people are referring to when they talk about the <b>DOM </b>(Document Object Model). In BBC games, things like the âRotate your Deviceâ message have to be HTML. You can create whole games in the DOM, using just HTML and CSS, but that is generally if you need to support something weird.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>o <b>CSS:</b> this is used for styling HTML elements, which otherwise just be rendered as the browser draws them. This would most normally be used for styling the embed of your game, or any other HTML elements you have included.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>o <b>JS:</b> and this does all the hardwork! Javascript creates, renders and manipulates everything inside your HTML &lt;canvas&gt; element.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>o <b>JSON: </b>is basically a spreadsheet. It should store all your text content which is rendered in the game, and also config settings, so things can be changed easily by your or the client without having to re-build the thing. This is especially good with the BBC, as you can tweak text and configuration without having to go through tech review again!</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\n\t\t\t<p><b>Whatâs all this WebGL nonsense then?</b></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><li>WebGL is a rendering engine that allows the browser to have GPU accelerated graphics in a web-game. </p></li>\n\n\t\t\t<p><li>The GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is part of a computer or device specifically designed for drawing graphics quickly and efficiently, and thus removes the burden from the CPU </li>(central processing unit).</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><li>WebGL can also do lots of cool stuff that a normal canvas element cannot:</p></li>\n\n\t\t\t<p>o GLSL, which is a shader language allowing you to do cool visual effects over all or part of your canvas. See some examples here: <a href=\"http://www.goodboydigital.com/pixijs/examples/15/indexAll.html\">http://www.goodboydigital.com/pixijs/examples/15/indexAll.html</a></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>o 3D! Using something like three.js: <a href=\"http://threejs.org/\">http://threejs.org/</a></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>o Dynamic lighting! Thought weâve never tried this yet, <a href=\"http://www.goodboydigital.com/pixijs/pixilights/\">http://www.goodboydigital.com/pixijs/pixilights/</a></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>o Boned animation! Little bits of asset, which are then manipulated on the fly using maths.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>o Probably loads more! </p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><li><b>So how do I use it? </b>If you are using Phaser, you are! Phaser uses the pixi.js renderer, which uses WebGL, and falls back to canvas if it is not available.</p></li>\n\n\t\t\t<p><b>Typescript, grunt, assets, etc: THE SOURCE</b></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><li><b>Typescript:</b> compiles to javascript, but is statically typed. (I think) this means it checks at compile time whether you are passing the correct type of thing into your </li>variable (number, string, etc), and tells you if there is a problem. There are probably other things, but this is what I know about it. </p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><li><b>Grunt:</b> is a taskrunner, and what we use to build the project. It takes all the source files and turns them into the build, and you can configure it do any part of the </li>process you like e.g.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>o Compile TS to JS</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>o RequireJS (which loads in modules, librarys etc into one file)</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>o Remove unneeded files</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>o Minification (removing all the whitespace from your code to make it smaller)</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>o Optimise images</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>o FTP deploy to the server</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><li><b>Images</b></p></li>\n\n\t\t\t<p>o <b>Images: </b>will graphics will be sprite based, usually PNGs</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>o <b>Animations </b>will be sequences of PNGs that play one after another</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>o All your images should be compiled into (preferably) one <b>spritesheet</b> â a big sheet of all the images, and a reference in the game. Use a program like TexturePacker to squeeze them in as tightly as possible.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Â§ <b>Why one spritesheet?</b> Unloading and loading sheets into memory is processor intensive for a device. If it can just load one into memory and thatâs it, amazing!</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Â§ Spritehsheets should be Power of 2 e.g. 512 x 512, 1024 x 1024, 2048 x 2048, etc. This is the sizes that GPUs use, and should make your game more performant (though if not using WebGL it doesnât matter).</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><li><b>Sound</b></p></li>\n\n\t\t\t<p>o <b>Is a lot better than it used to be!</b></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>o Web Audio supports polyphonic sound, effects like reverb and more</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>o Internet Explorer and older Android browsers still an issue - Phaser sound falls back to the older Audio API, so it can only play one sound at a time</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>o Should effects should be concatenated into sound sprites, which is one long track with all the sounds in, with a time reference for each one.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>o You need MP3 and OGG versions of your sounds.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>o Music should be as individual looping sounds, and kept as short as possible.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>o Use Soundsprite to create them: <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/soundsprite\">https://www.npmjs.com/package/soundsprite</a></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><b>Other things!</b></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><li><b>Libraries:</b></p></li>\n\n\t\t\t<p>o There are plenty of good open source javascript libraries for doing lots of cool things. Some we have used on DMK include:</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Â§ <b>Hammer</b>: for touch gestures</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Â§ <b>Underscore</b>: extends javascript with lots of new functionality you donât need to write</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Â§ <b>jQuery</b>: same as above </p>\n\n\t\t\t<p>Â§ <b>JSONpack</b>: for compressing JSON files so they could be emailed (long story)</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><li><b>IDEs for Javascript/Typescript:</b></p></li>\n\n\t\t\t<p>o If they use something like IntelliJ or Visual Studio Code will make life a lot easier for your developers: error highlighting, lookups, hints for Typescript.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<h3>things to be aware ofâ¦</h3>\n\n\t\t\t<p><li><b>Performance</b> is <i>always</i> an issue on devices. Save lots of time for optimising your game, and make sure you test it on devices throughout the build process, not </li>just at the end!</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><li><b>iOS</b> for some reason needs a touch/click event before it will play any sound. Make sure you have one of these before anything important happens in your game!</p></li>\n\n\t\t\t<p><li><b>All browsers</b> will perform differently, so again, leave lots of time for testing. REMEMBER that Twitter and Facebook both have their own internal browsers now. 50% of </li>the mobile traffic to Eastenders Storyteller is the Facebook internal browser! FFS!</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><li><b>Accessibility</b> for the blind (e.g. tab controls and screen readers) has been bad for a while in Phaser and canvas games in general, as the tools rely on the DOM to be </li>read. The way to get around this is to make all the UI as DOM elements and overlay the phaser canvas with them. (See Something Special and Deadly Defenders.)</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><li><b>File size, </b>mobile games may be loaded over mobile networks and we should take care to not over use end usersâ data plans. Libraries like require js can help by </li>minifying and combining all the javascript, but content is the real killer.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><li><b>Scope, </b>The DMK projects are the exception as opposed to the rule. It is best to have a good mechanic that is well polished than lots of content, which will damage </li>performance, and increase filesize. KISS!</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t</section>\n</div>\n"
